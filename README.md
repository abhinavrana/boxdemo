Demo App for box integration using reactJS and Express
==========================================================================================================

**This demo app demonstrates how to use the Box Content Preview UI Element from within a React based application. The UI Elements require an access token to work.**

Setup
-----
1. Clone this repo via `git clone git@github.com:abhinavrana/boxdemo.git`.
2. Add auth token to [src/main.js](src/main.js).(Other token is added using example account for box.com and can be used directly, change token to link with you account.)
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm start` to run the webpack dev server.
5. Navigate to http://localhost:8080.

**Other important points :**
1. If you are running on local add your local url to your custom app on https://app.box.com/developers/console
